When I went to the store to design my kitchen with the people of the store, the salesperson came up with the idea of a little wall to put some stuff on like spices, olive oil, or kitchen utensils. They provided a piece of countertop to use on the little wall, but they weren't gonna provide the wall itself.

The width of the countertop was pretty perfect to make a small book case for comics.

I started designing in Sketchup.

First the skeleton of the case:

After that, I started putting the skeleton together. Having drawn it in Sketchup gave me an easy way to check measurements. If you compare the Sketchup design with the actual skeleton, you will find some differences. While creating the skeleton, I noticed I didn't need that many cross beams, so most differences will be because of those things.

Next the case how it would look next to my kitchen counter:

As you can see, I covered up the skeleton with MDF which had to be painted. I justed picked the darkest paint I could find and began painting the MDF.

{{< figure src="/20180712_213327_001.jpg" title="Just making sure the comics would fit." width="70%" >}}

When the paint dried, I put the case where it was supposed to be. I know the lighting in the picture isn't all that but you can notice the paint matches perfectly with the color of the kitchen cabinets.

After that I added some small pieces of wood to the inside of the gap in the front to act as brackets for the comics.

I ordered some plexiglass online, pre-cut to my requested measurement. Combining this with some of the remainder of the MDF, I created a couple of drawers, if you can call 'em that.

Putting this all together, you end up with something like this.

At this moment, the countertop was still not fixed to the case. In a future post, you'll see what I intended with this.
